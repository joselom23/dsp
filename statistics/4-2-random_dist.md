[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

### Exercise 4.2: 
The numbers generated by random.random are supposed to be uniform between 0 and 1; that is, every value in the range should have the same probability.  

Generate 1000 numbers from random.random and plot their PMF and CDF. Is the distribution uniform?

#### Answer:

Importing libraries:

#Importing libraries

```
%matplotlib inline

import numpy as np
import nsfg
import first
import thinkstats2
import thinkplot
```

Generating 1000 samples from the uniform distribution
```
sample = np.random.random(1000)
```

Generating Pmf plot
```
pmf = thinkstats2.Pmf(sample)
thinkplot.Pmf(pmf)
thinkplot.Config(xlabel='Random variate', ylabel='PMF')
```

Generating Cdf plot
```
cdf = thinkstats2.Cdf(sample)
thinkplot.Cdf(cdf)
thinkplot.Config(xlabel='Random variate', ylabel='CDF')
```
